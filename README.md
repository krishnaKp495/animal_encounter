Animal Encounter Outcome Prediction
This project aims to predict the outcome of animal encounters and the probability of one animal winning using two machine learning models: Neural Networks and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to simulate animal encounters based on various quantitative and qualitative traits, and predict the likelihood of one animal winning over another. The model uses data on animal characteristics and traits to train both a Neural Network and a KNN model to output:

Outcome Prediction: Which animal will win the encounter.
Probability of Winning: The probability score associated with the winning outcome.
Key Features
Dual-model approach: Combines Neural Networks for learning complex patterns and KNN for instance-based predictions.
Predicts both binary outcomes (win/loss) and probabilistic outcomes (likelihood of winning).
Flexible input system for traits like size, speed, aggression, and more.
Models Used
1. Neural Network
The neural network model is trained on animal characteristics to learn intricate relationships between features and the outcome. It performs well with complex, non-linear data.

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is an instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions by finding the closest data points (neighbors) to the query. It performs well when similar animals encounter each other.
